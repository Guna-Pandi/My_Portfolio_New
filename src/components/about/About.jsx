              As a front-end web developer, I am responsible for implementing
              designs provided by UI/UX designers, ensuring that websites are
              optimized for performance and accessibility, and collaborating
              with back-end developers to integrate front-end functionality with
              back-end logic. I also take charge of ensuring that the website
              looks great on all devices and screens. I believe in life-long
              learning, and I am constantly on the lookout for more efficient
              ways to do things. To find out more about what I can do for you,
